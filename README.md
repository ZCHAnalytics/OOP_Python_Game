# Welcome to the Hangman game! 

This is a classic word-guessing game where you try to uncover a mystery word letter by letter. You have a limited number of attempts, so choose your guesses wisely.

## Overview

Store-telling, art, and programming require creativity and problem-solving skills. Artists and programmers alike must make decisions about composition, structure, and style to achieve their desired outcome.

This Hangman game showcases various object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts and skills, including:

- **Class Design:** Utilises the Hangman class to encapsulate the game logic and attributes.
- **Encapsulation:** Attributes such as the word to be guessed, the number of lives, and the guessed letters are encapsulated within the Hangman class.
- **Methods:** The game includes methods for checking guesses, asking for user input, and playing the game.

## How to Play
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python installed.
3. Run the hangman.py file.
4. Guess letters to reveal the mystery word.
5. You have 5 lives. Each incorrect guess costs you a life.
6. If you guess all the letters before running out of lives, you win! If not, better luck next time.
7. Follow the on-screen prompts to guess the letters and complete the word.

Happy guessing! ðŸŽ‰
